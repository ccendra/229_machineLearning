# A Data-Driven Approach for Predicting the Elastic Properties of Inorganic Materials

The goal of this project is to aid in the rapid design and screening of new materials by bypassing the need for first-principle computational methods and, instead, use fast supervised ML algorithms to predict the elastic modulus of inorganic materials. We use linear regression, a simple neural network, and a random forest regressor to output the predicted elastic modulus.
